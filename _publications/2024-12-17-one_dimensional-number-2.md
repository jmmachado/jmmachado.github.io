In this paper we propose an approach to approximate an arbitrary probability measure with 1-dimensional structures. This is achieved by means of a new variational problem consisting of the minimization of the Wasserstein distance of this given measure to all probability measures uniformly distributed over connected 1-rectifiable sets plus a term penalizing the total length of its support.
