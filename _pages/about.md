Hi! And welcome to my personal website! I am currently a post-doctoral research in the [Optimal Transportation team](https://sites.google.com/view/ot-lagrange/), lead by G. Carlier, A. Figalli, Q. Mérigot and F. Santambrogio, from the Lagrange Mathematical and Computational Research Center. I did my PhD at Université Paris-Dauphine and the  [Mokaplan Inria team](https://team.inria.fr/mokaplan/team-members/) under the supervision of Antonin Chambolle and Vincent Duval. Before that I did my studies in Rio, at EMAp FGV under the guidance of Maria Soledad Aronna. 

My research is focused on the Calculus of Variations in a broad sense, primarily in the fields of Optimal Transport and Geometric Measure Theory, but I am happy to think about any nice problem with a variational flavor.
